# ASD Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains the machine learning project **"ASD Detection"**, developed during a Machine Learning Internship from from 01st July 2019 to 31st August 2019 at Verzeo Ltd. The objective of the project was to build and evaluate models to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in individuals using various classification algorithms and real-world behavioral data.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `ASD_Project_Code/`  
  Core scripts and notebooks used for:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Data Preprocessing (including missing value handling, normalization, and encoding)
  - Model Training and Evaluation using SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees
  - Metrics computation including F-beta Score, ROC-AUC, and Cross-Validation

- `Internship_Assignments/`  
  This folder includes minor hands-on assignments completed as part of the internship. These include foundational ML and Python exercises that supported the learning journey.

## ‚úÖ Project Highlights

- Applied one-hot encoding and feature normalization
- Achieved up to **100% accuracy** using SVM and Decision Trees
- Compared multiple ML algorithms based on:
  - F-beta score
  - Cross-validation score
  - ROC-AUC score
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization

## üìú Certification

Upon successful completion of the internship and final evaluation, I appeared for the **Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Exam: Introduction to Programming Using Python (98-381)** and earned the certification.

The certification is verifiable via my LinkedIn profile:
